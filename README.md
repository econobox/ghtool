# ghtool

`ghtool` is a command-line tool for interacting with all the extra
data associated with a GitHub repository that doesn't come from `git`
itself.

## Features

### Labels

- [x] List the labels in a repository
      ([#3](https://github.com/sorenmortensen/ghtool/issues/3)).
- [x] Copy labels from one repository to another
      ([#4](https://github.com/sorenmortensen/ghtool/issues/4)).

## hubcaps

It should be noted that this is essentially a glorified command-line
interface for [`hubcaps`](https://github.com/softprops/hubcaps);
`hubcaps` does all the heavy lifting.
