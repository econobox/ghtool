# ghtool

`ghtool` is a command-line tool for interacting with all the extra
data associated with a GitHub repository that doesn't come from `git`
itself.

## Features

### Note

This is a side project. I'm mainly driven to implement features in
`ghtool` by my own need for them in my workflow. That said, though, if
there's a feature that you'd like to see implemented, feel free to
file an issue and I'm likely to work with you to get it working (or at
least consider it seriously). I'll certainly accept pull requests if
you develop a feature yourself.

### Labels

- [ ] List the labels in a repository ([#3](https://github.com/sorenmortensen/ghtool/issues/3)).
- [ ] Copy labels from one repository to another ([#4](https://github.com/sorenmortensen/ghtool/issues/4)).

## hubcaps

It should be noted that this is essentially a glorified command-line
interface for [`hubcaps`](https://github.com/softprops/hubcaps);
`hubcaps` does all the heavy lifting.
