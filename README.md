# ghtool

`ghtool` is a command-line tool for interacting with all the extra
data associated with a GitHub repository that doesn't come from `git`
itself.

## Features

*Note*: This is a side project. I'm mainly driven to implement
features in `ghtool` by my own need for them in my workflow. That
said, though, if there's a feature that you'd like to see implemented,
feel free to file an issue and I'm likely to work with you to get it
working (or at least consider it seriously). I'll certainly accept
pull requests if you develop a feature yourself.

### Labels

- [x] List the labels in a repository
      ([#3](https://github.com/sorenmortensen/ghtool/issues/3)).
- [ ] Copy labels from one repository to another
      ([#4](https://github.com/sorenmortensen/ghtool/issues/4)).

It should be noted that this is essentially a glorified command-line
interface for [`hubcaps`](https://github.com/softprops/hubcaps);
`hubcaps` does all the heavy lifting.
